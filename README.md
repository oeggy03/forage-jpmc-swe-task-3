# Graph for Stock Price Tracking 

This is a live graph that can display the data feed in a clear and visually appealing way for traders to monitor.

The purpose of this graph is to monitor and determine when a trading opportunity may arise as a result of the temporary weakening of a correlation between two stock prices. Given this graph, the trader should be able to quickly and easily notice when the ratio moves too far from the average historical correlation which we'll assume is +/-10% of the 12-month historical average ratio.
